# Sentiment Analysis Project with NLTK using Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

In this project, we'll use NLTK, a powerful library for natural language processing and text analysis, to analyze the sentiment of text data. We'll provide a step-by-step guide and examples for conducting sentiment analysis on your own text data.

## Features

- Perform sentiment analysis on text data.
- Determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
- An easy-to-follow tutorial with code examples.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python and text data preprocessing.
- NLTK library installed (`pip install nltk`).
